# Code-Refactoring
Code that has been refactored for the Horiseon webpage.

## Description
This web application was built to market search engine opimization for business websites. It also advertises online reputation management and social media marketing. It is intended to provide the neccessary information to make potential costumers understand the service provided and then buy-in. My refactoring of the code made the HTML/CSS elements and classes more semantic, fixed the broken "Search Engine Optimization" link, changed the color scheme of the page to frame the main image better, and placed the CSS rules in an order that better matches the flow of the webpage. I learned to better understand how CSS and HTML work together by refactoring the code.

## Usage
The navigation bar at the top of the webpage has three links that will take you to each respective part of the main section of the webpage, which include: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. The aside portion of the webpage lists the benefits of using Horiseon, which include: lead generation, cost management, and brand awareness.

## Credits
The original webpage was created by Horiseon Social Solution Services. The code refactoring was done by Andrew Phinney.
